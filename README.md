# Comparing-Seattle-Baltimore-Household-Income-in-Python
Using open data from the Opportunity Insights teamâ€™s Opportunity Atlas to show the social mobility in Baltimore and Seattle in Excel

## Background
With the data from [Opportunity Atlas](https://www.opportunityatlas.org/), I compared the social mobility between Baltimore City and Greater Seattle Area. 

Opportunity Atlas contains anonymous data following 20 million Americans from childhood to their mid-30s. I chose the average household income, median household income in 1990 and median household income in 2016 to see the growth rate of median household income. I then look at factors that possibly influence the social mobility such as the teenage brith rate, high school graduation rate, college graduation rate and job growth rate in both cities. 

## Instructions
To start with, I first import packages that I need for this projects, which are plotly, numpy and etc. I then manipulated the data and adjusted it so that it is ready to plot, including getting rid of the unuseful columns, and choosing the right rows. Then, as shown below, I plot the median household income for Baltimore and Seattle in 1990 and 2016, both in 2015 values. 

## Conclusion
The following chart shows the median househould income in 1990 and 2016 for Baltimore, Seattle and the nation as a whole. The growth rate for the median household income for Baltimore and Seattle are 1.5% and 19.3% respectively, while the nationwide growth rate is 9.0%. In other words, Seattle has a comparably higher social mobility than Baltimore.
